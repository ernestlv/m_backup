			Risotto is the ultimate social, cook-together food, since it requires constant attention while cooking. Mastering the dish is all about paying attention in the last minutes, getting a feel for what it should look and taste like when it's done cooking. But even if it's served in the fanciest restaurants and has a reputation for being tricky, perfect risotto is easier than it seems. Just channel your inner Italian chef and dive in.
